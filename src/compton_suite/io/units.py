"""Shared pint unit registry.

**One registry for the whole suite** -- every consumer (``compton_suite.gui``,
``xigma_i``, ``kascade``) imports this exact ``ureg``/``Quantity``, not one
of its own, because pint quantities built from different registries can't
interoperate. ``constants.py`` also derives every physical constant from
this same registry's built-in CODATA values, so "physical constants" and
"pint registry" are one mechanism, not two.

Also defines a custom ``"light_time"`` context that lets a length convert
to/from a duration via ``length = c * time``. Both ``xigma_i`` and
``kascade`` store pulse/bunch "length" natively as a position-domain sigma
(``sigma_par_L = c * pulse_duration``, see each engine's
``params_to_config``) rather than as a time, so ``PULSE_DURATION``/
``BUNCH_LENGTH`` quantities need this context to move between the unit a
GUI would naturally show (seconds, picoseconds) and the unit the physics
code actually stores (metres, centimetres).
