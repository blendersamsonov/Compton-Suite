"""One canonical convention + unit per physical meaning.

The canonical choices below match what this model's own ``Config`` (see
``gui_adapter.py``) already uses internally: a Gaussian width is
canonically the RMS of the *intensity*/density profile, a duration is
canonically a time in seconds (even though ``Config`` stores the
corresponding field as ``c * duration`` in metres -- see ``units.py``'s
light-time context), and a laser amplitude is canonically its peak value.
Nothing here is arbitrary; it was chosen to make ``to_canonical`` a no-op
convention-wise for this model's own ``XIGMA_SPEC`` (``spec.py``), so a
mismatch shows up as loudly as possible if this model's convention ever
disagrees with a caller's.
