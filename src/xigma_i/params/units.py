"""Shared pint unit registry.

One registry for this package (pint quantities from different registries
can't interoperate), plus a custom ``"light_time"`` context that lets a
length convert to/from a duration via ``length = c * time``. This model
stores pulse/bunch "length" natively as a position-domain sigma
(``sigma_par_L = c * pulse_duration``, see ``gui_adapter.params_to_config``)
rather than as a time, so ``PULSE_DURATION``/``BUNCH_LENGTH`` quantities
need this context to move between the unit a GUI would naturally show
(seconds, picoseconds) and the unit this model actually stores (metres,
centimetres).
