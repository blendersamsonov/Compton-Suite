"""CODATA-style physical constants used by the GUI's local formula helpers
(peak_a0, sigma_e, the spread-estimate box, ...).

Re-exported from ``compton_io.constants`` (the shared, pint-derived
source of truth also used by ``xigma_i``/``kascade``) rather than defined
here -- this module used to duplicate its own literal copy, on the same
precedent ``xigma_i.gui_adapter`` set of hand-duplicating a couple of
constants to avoid a cross-repo import; that precedent is gone now that
``compton_io`` exists specifically to be cross-imported instead of
copied. Calls ``bootstrap.setup_paths()`` itself since ``app.py`` imports
this module before ``models.discover_models()`` runs.
